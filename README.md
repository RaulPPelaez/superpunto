#Superpunto
SFML/Modern OpenGL clone of mrevenga's SDL punto ( http://punto.sourceforge.net/ )

**PLEASE GO TO BRANCH SDL_OGL45 IF YOUR SYSTEM HAS OpenGL 4.5 AVAILABLE**

SDL_OGL45 branch is a much better version of Superpunto, it has more capabilities and has better visuals. Use te master version only if you dont have access to OpenGL 4.5.

You can check the suported OpenGL version using: glxinfo | grep OpenGL


#COMPILATION
Run the Makefile using $ make

Additionally you can define STATIC to include all the dependencies in the executable (-DSTATIC=yes). However, this option is not currently tested and is only recommended for distribution.


Dependencies:

1. SFML-2.0+ (2.3 recommended) and its dependencies. Only libsfml-graphics, libsfml-system and libsfml-window are required

2. OpenGL 3.0+ (3.3+ recommended)

You can grab a compiled version (**no need for SFML and its dependencies in your system**) in "releases".

Known to work in Ubuntu 14/15. You can install SFML by $ apt-get install libsfml-dev

You can also compile it yourself from https://github.com/SFML/SFML

#USAGE
Use with $ ./spunto inputfile [opts]

run ./spunto -h for information about the available options and controls.


inputfile should have the following structure:
>\#Lx=X;Ly=Y;Lz=Z; Comments are used to separate frames, you can force the size of the simulation box starting the comment with Lx=X;Ly=Y;Lz=Z; as in this example

>X1 Y1 Z1 r1 c1 #You can comment here aswell! If your file has more than
   
>X2 ...         #5 columns, the rest will be ignored!

>.

>.

>.

>\# frame=2

>X1 Y1 Z1 r1 c1

>.

>.

>.

>\# frame = 3

r1 is the size of the superpunto.

c1 is its color.

both of these parameters are optional, if you only set 4 columns, the 4th will be interpreted as the color.

If you generate a movie, use gif2mp4 to convert it to mp4.

#COLORS
**Using palette** (Default)

The colors are selected using C++ rand(), setting the initial seed to a constant called palette, this constant defines a color palette with colors randomly distributed between 0 (black) and 255^3(white). You can change the palette seed using the --palette option. By default palette=923302100. The generated color palette contains 1000 colors.

**In the file, the colors are specified** from one of the 1000 available using an integer number between 0 and 1000 (higher values will be reduced to this range).

**Using RGB id** (by passing the flag --RGB when running spunto)

if --RGB is present the color column is interpreted as a RGB hexadecimal value, written as an integer.
So full red (0xff0000) would be 255 and white(0xFFffFF) would be 16777215.


#CONTROLS
You can move around using:

1. WASD for moving in your XY plane
2. LSHIFT and Lctrl to go up and down
3. E and Q to roll
4. Keep LAlt pressed to look around using the mouse
5. Move faster/slower using + -
6. Numbers 1-6 to rotate the system in the X, Y o Z axis 

You can go through time using:

1. Space/R to go to the next/previous frame
2. Press M to autoplay the frames at 30 FPS
3. Press T to go to the last frame
4. Press B to go to the last frame

You can take screenshots and record some frames in a gif using:

1. Press L or start using --record to take a screenshot every frame, these will be converted to gif at exit. You can move around while recording
2. Press C to take a single screenshot.

Run spunto -h to see a complete list of options in the current version.
